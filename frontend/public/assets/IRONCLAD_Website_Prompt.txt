IRONCLAD
GYM WEBSITE - FULL BUILD PROMPT
Version 1.0  ·  Complete Developer & Designer Brief

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Build a full-stack, production-grade gym management and fitness web application called IRONCLAD. The platform serves gym members with personalised workout programs and meal plans, powered by user profile data. The design must be clean, professional, and visually distinct - inspired by the layout philosophy of workout.cool (multi-section dashboard, card-based UI, smooth transitions) but with a completely original theme, colour palette, and visual identity so there is zero resemblance or IP concern.

Website URL / Brand name: IRONCLAD
Category: Fitness & Gym Management SaaS
Primary Audience: Gym members, fitness enthusiasts, personal trainers

2. DESIGN SYSTEM & VISUAL IDENTITY
2.1 Theme
The website must support both Dark Mode and Light Mode. The default should be Dark Mode. Users can toggle the theme from any page via a clearly visible icon in the top navigation bar (sun/moon icon). The selected theme must persist using localStorage so the preference is remembered across sessions.
2.2 Colour Palette
DARK MODE
• Primary background: #0D0D0D (near black)
• Surface / Card background: #141414
• Elevated surface: #1C1C1C
• Primary accent: #E8E0D0 (warm off-white / bone)
• Secondary accent: #B87333 (copper / iron tone)
• Text primary: #EDEDED
• Text secondary: #888888
• Border: rgba(255,255,255,0.07)
• Danger / error: #E05252
• Success: #4CAF7D
LIGHT MODE
• Primary background: #F5F4F0
• Surface / Card background: #FFFFFF
• Elevated surface: #EFEFEB
• Primary accent: #1A1A2E (deep navy)
• Secondary accent: #B87333 (copper - consistent across modes)
• Text primary: #111111
• Text secondary: #666666
• Border: rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
2.3 Typography

• UI headings & labels: Rajdhani - weight 600 / 700
• Body text & descriptions: Inter - weight 400 / 500
• Monospace / data: JetBrains Mono
Font sizes follow an 8-point scale: 12 / 14 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 56px.
2.4 Animations & Motion
All animations must feel intentional, fast, and professional. Do NOT use heavy or distracting effects. Required animations:
• Page transitions: fade-in + slight upward slide (translateY 20px ? 0, opacity 0 ? 1, 300ms ease-out)
• Card hover: subtle lift with box-shadow deepening (transform: translateY(-4px), 200ms)
• Button press: scale down slightly on :active (transform: scale(0.97))
• Form input focus: border colour transition from default to accent (200ms)
• Navigation active indicator: sliding underline / pill that animates between tabs
• Dashboard stat counters: count-up animation on page load (0 ? actual value, 1.2s ease)
• Skeleton loaders: shimmer pulse on all data-loading states
• Toast / notification popup: slide in from top-right (300ms), auto-dismiss after 4s with fade-out
• Modal open/close: scale from 0.95 ? 1 with fade (250ms)
• Sidebar expand/collapse: smooth width transition (200ms ease-in-out)

3. GLOBAL NAVIGATION BAR
Present on all authenticated pages. Fixed to the top. Blurred glass background (backdrop-filter: blur(12px)).
LEFT SIDE
• IRONCLAD logo (text-based, Bebas Neue, copper accent on 'I' glyph)
RIGHT SIDE ICONS (LEFT TO RIGHT)
• Language selector icon - globe icon - opens a dropdown list of supported languages
• Bell icon - opens notification panel - acts as reminder system (see Section 8)
• Dark/Light theme toggle - sun/moon icon
• User avatar circle - shows first letter of user's first name in large text, coloured background derived from username hash - clicking opens profile dropdown
3.1 Language Selector
The globe icon in the navbar opens a dropdown listing all supported languages. When the user selects a language, every visible text string on the website must update to the selected language instantly without page reload (client-side i18n). Supported languages at launch:
• English (default)
• Hindi (??????)
• Spanish (Español)
• French (Français)
• German (Deutsch)
• Japanese (???)
• Arabic (???????) - RTL layout support required
• Portuguese (Português)
Use i18next or a similar i18n library. All user-facing strings must be extracted into translation JSON files (one per language). The selected language must be saved to localStorage.

4. AUTHENTICATION PAGES
4.1 Signup Page

Split screen: Left panel shows a bold IRONCLAD brand graphic with a motivational quote. Right panel contains the signup form. On mobile, collapse to single-column with the brand graphic as a top banner.

4.2 Login Page

PAGE LAYOUT
Same split-screen structure as the Signup page for visual consistency. The left panel graphic may differ - show a gym action illustration or bold typography.
FORM FIELDS
• Page heading: 'Welcome Back' with the IRONCLAD logo above
• Email - email input
• Password - password input with show/hide toggle
• Forgot Password link - positioned immediately below the password input field, right-aligned, links to /forgot-password
• Submit button: 'Login' - full width, copper accent
SOCIAL LOGIN

FOOTER LINK

POST-LOGIN REDIRECT
• On successful login, if the user has NOT completed their profile onboarding, redirect to /onboarding
• If the user HAS completed onboarding, redirect to /dashboard
4.3 Forgot Password Page
Route: /forgot-password
• Single field: Email - user enters their registered email
• Submit button: 'Send Reset Link'
• On submit: show a success message 'Check your inbox. We sent a reset link to [email]'
• Backend sends a time-limited (60 minutes) password reset link to the email
• Route /reset-password?token=... renders a form with New Password and Confirm Password fields

5. USER AVATAR / PROFILE INDICATOR
After the user logs in, their identity is shown in the top-right corner of every page as a circular avatar badge. Rules:
• Extract the first character of the user's First Name (e.g. 'A' for 'Arjun')
• Display this character in large, bold font (Bebas Neue or Rajdhani 700) centred inside the circle
• The circle background colour is algorithmically derived from the user's full name using a consistent hashing function - this ensures the same user always sees the same colour, and different users see different colours
• Suggested palette for hashed colours: a curated list of 12 rich, dark-mode-friendly accent colours (deep teal, forest green, indigo, rust, slate blue, olive, crimson, etc.) - the hash selects one deterministically
• Clicking the avatar circle opens a dropdown menu with: Profile, Settings, My Plan, Logout

6. ONBOARDING FLOW (Post-Signup Profile Setup)
After a new user signs up, before they can access the dashboard, they must complete a multi-step onboarding form to capture data needed to generate personalised workout and meal plans. This is a step-by-step wizard UI - show a progress bar at the top (e.g. Step 2 of 4).
Step 1 - Physical Stats

15. IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

??  ORIGINALITY: The design must be visually original. Do NOT copy the layout, component structure, colour scheme, typography, or animations of workout.cool or any other existing fitness platform. Use the concept of a dashboard-based fitness app as inspiration only. Every visual decision must be independently designed.
??  NO IP INFRINGEMENT: All icons, illustrations, images, and fonts used must be open-source, royalty-free, or properly licensed. Do not use brand logos (Google, Facebook, Twitter) beyond what is covered under their official brand guidelines for login buttons.
?? RESPONSIVE DESIGN: All pages must be fully responsive - mobile-first. Test layouts at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px breakpoints. The sidebar collapses to a bottom tab bar on mobile.
?? ACCESSIBILITY: All interactive elements must have aria labels. Colour contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards in both light and dark mode. Keyboard navigation must be fully functional.
?? PERFORMANCE: Lazy-load all images and YouTube iframes. Use Intersection Observer to trigger animations only when elements enter the viewport. Code-split routes.
?? SECURITY: Never expose API keys on the frontend. Use httpOnly cookies for auth tokens. Rate-limit the login endpoint. Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
