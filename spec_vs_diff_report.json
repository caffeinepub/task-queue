  "summary": "All four requirements (REQ-21 through REQ-24) appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-21 is addressed in Sidebar.tsx with delete buttons for custom categories only. REQ-22 is addressed with the KEYWORD_EMOJI_MAP and getSuggestedEmoji function in Sidebar.tsx. REQ-23 is addressed in Login.tsx with the same logo path as DashboardHeader. REQ-24 is addressed in Signup.tsx with real-time password hint and popup blocking. One concern: auth.ts enforcement for REQ-24 is not directly visible in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "Enforce password minimum 6 characters rule in frontend/src/utils/auth.ts signup validation logic — if password is fewer than 6 characters, block signup and show a custom popup with 'Password must be at least 6 characters.'",
      "reason": "The diff does not include any changes to frontend/src/utils/auth.ts. The file summary for auth.ts does not mention a minimum password length check being added. The enforcement in Signup.tsx is client-side only (checks before calling signup()), but the requirement explicitly states the rule must also be enforced inside auth.ts.",
